# Bayes Interactive

This web app visualizes **Bayes' theorem** through a set of sliders and an SVG diagram. The application allows you to manipulate the prior probability of a hypothesis and the likelihood of evidence in both the true and false cases. As you adjust the sliders the graphic and the computed posterior probability update instantly. The goal is to help students build intuition for how beliefs are updated when new evidence appears.

## Quick start

Clone repository, open `bayes_interactive.html` in your browser.

## Planned tutorials and scenarios

The repository will gradually include short tutorials illustrating classical uses of Bayes' theorem, such as:

- Analysing a medical test's reliability when the disease is rare.
- Distinguishing between biased and fair coins using repeated tosses.

These scenarios will highlight how the sliders correspond to the quantities in Bayes' formula and how the posterior changes.
